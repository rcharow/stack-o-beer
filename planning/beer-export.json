Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":40,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Quelque Chose","price":"15.53","rating":1,"srm":0,"stock":30,"style_id":70,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49cd"},"upc":0}

It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\n\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":480,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"MÃ¶nchshof Premium Schwarzbier","price":"6.07","rating":0,"srm":0,"stock":11,"style_id":86,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49dc"},"upc":0}

An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes.

It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year.

In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":1805,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"1554 Enlightened Black Ale","price":"2.78","rating":0,"srm":0,"stock":80,"style_id":72,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49cf"},"upc":0}

It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\n\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\n\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\n\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":2447,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Big Eye IPA","price":"11.43","rating":1,"srm":0,"stock":5,"style_id":31,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a5"},"upc":0}

Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":2530,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Gubna Imperial IPA","price":"10.65","rating":2,"srm":0,"stock":16,"style_id":32,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a6"},"upc":0}

Glowing a deep amber color, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe, Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, Saaz, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas, not found in any other beer.\n\nOriginally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open), Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again.\n\nWe brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV, 1.068 OG) all year 'round.

It is this special blend of spices that gives Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale its unique character, complexity and refreshing drinkability.

Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \"Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966.

There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips.

Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland.

The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping.

This beer is hugely delicious so it will need your undivided attention (the chores can wait....trust us).\"","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":4537,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Double Crooked Tree I.P.A.","price":"3.96","rating":1,"srm":0,"stock":99,"style_id":32,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a6"},"upc":0}

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.\n\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\n\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\n\nLimited Availability April through June.\n\nDonâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\n\nAvailable April through June.\n\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\n\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\n\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\n\u0009\n\nIBU 95\n\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\n\u0009\n\n\nphoto: chris mather\nRatings, Awards \u0026 Notables\n\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\n2007 World Beer Awards\n\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\n2006 International Beer Challenge\n\nGold Medal, 92 Points\n2006 World Beer Championships\n\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\n\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\n5 out 5 stars \nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\nâ€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€\nâ€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":4632,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Hop Henge Imperial IPA","price":"17.71","rating":2,"srm":0,"stock":60,"style_id":32,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a6"},"upc":0}

The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\n\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We donâ€™t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":4674,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Blast Furnace Oatmeal Stout","price":"3.15","rating":1,"srm":0,"stock":17,"style_id":21,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf499b"},"upc":0}

Allay your fears my friends because Iâ€™m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.

We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\n\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness.

It is particularly nice with spicy seafood and with fine cheeses.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":5048,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Local 1","price":"19.16","rating":1,"srm":0,"stock":59,"style_id":65,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49c7"},"upc":0}

In England most of the beer is some kind of \"bitter\".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name \"bitter.\"  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\n\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":5133,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Calico Amber Ale","price":"18.03","rating":3,"srm":0,"stock":44,"style_id":33,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a7"},"upc":0}

Hopheads. \n\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: â€œWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?â€\n\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find.

Cheers!","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":5179,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Iniquity Imperial Black Ale","price":"16.98","rating":0,"srm":0,"stock":83,"style_id":-1,"upc":0}

A subdued malt character nicely complements the hop complexity and produces an orangey amber hue.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":5315,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Dundee Pale Ale","price":"18.61","rating":4,"srm":0,"stock":50,"style_id":26,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a0"},"upc":0}

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\n\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\n\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff.

Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale.","filepath":"","ibu":0,"label":5558,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","name":"Sculpin India Pale Ale","price":"9.75","rating":0,"srm":0,"stock":38,"style_id":31,"style_oid":{"$oid":"55760427bc48bd122edf49a5"},"upc":0}
